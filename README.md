# playerank-weighter
Repository for the Project of Machine learning at Unimi.

An alternative algorithm for the weighting module of [PlayeRank](https://github.com/mesosbrodleto/playerank).
SVM, Decision tree, and Logisitic regression algorithms are implemented by scratch (as it was the task of the project) to obtain a vector of parameters that assign weights to different events in football in order to evaluate a player or a team (like a pass, a shot or a foul).
