# PlayeRank weighter module from scratch
An alternative algorithm for the weighting module of [PlayeRank](https://github.com/mesosbrodleto/playerank).<br>
**SVM** and **Logisitic regression** algorithms are implemented by scratch (as it was the task of the project) in order to obtain a vector of parameters that assigns **weights to different events in football** in order to evaluate a player or a team (like a pass, a shot or a foul). Models performance is benchmarked also against non-parametric models like **k-NN** and **Decision tree**, always implemented from sratch. ðŸ”¢
